# notepad-is-effort. Built for C, written in python

This is great for lazy people who are sick of repeatedly compiling using the command line but don't want to dowload a fully featured editor.

notepad-is-effort is a small python program using tkinter and less than 400 lines of code.

It has features like syntax highlighting and allows you to find indexes quickly.

This project is compatible with windows 10.
It has not been tested on other operating systems

If you find any bugs please report them, it would be greatly appreciated.

I hope you find this project useful.
