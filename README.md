# notepad-is-effort. Built for C, written in python

This is great for lazy people who are sick of repeatedly compiling using the command line but don't want to dowload a fully featured editor.

It has features like syntax highlighting and allows you to find indexes quickly.

This project is compatible with windows 10.
It has not been tested on other operating systems

If you find any bugs please report them, it would be greatly appreciated.

This is my first project on github, any constructive feedback would be helpful

I hope you find this project useful.
